- kill captured ship (possibly only when in swarm)
  makes the swarm bug: some bees stay in the air: 8800 table probably wrongly updated
- kill boss that captured ship: ship doesn't attack
  then kill last boss in level: captured ship doesn't move anymore

  move.b	#9,(a0)+                         	| [$10B9 should make rogue ship attack but does not, and ship is now stuck
   debug: setup_motion_for_attackers_108a loop
         case_diving_attack_or_loop_2422 called if 8802 set to 9
		  but another 99xx value is not correct (0x80) and no object
		  is moving (but possibly there's a corruption!)
		 
Amiga: monitor 8802 for write when ship is captured

main: case_shot_captured_ship_243C
main: debug f_update_objects_23e0 when captured ship not moving
- missing/wrong sounds: swarm pusling sound: rip from MAME or YT video with invincible & attack sound off
- stage 14: big shield flag not refreshed
- capture bottom beam is red because of Namco logo hack
  should detect namco logo and act accordignly

- flag tick timer sometimes super slow: loops at l_120B
- yellow flash at some point!!!
- red flashes (frame drop) even with very few sprites with cycle exact!!
  (why are we flashing red when only ship and double shot (single shot?) are displayed!
- c_plyr_initials_entry_hilite_line: one letter is yellow, rest is white/cyan??
  doesn't matter!!!
- (c) namco part of letters are cyan
- DSW skill level?
- demo: continues after ship is killed, but with wrong actions
- double buffering: don't double buffer last plane for tiles
- double shot should optimize height
- autoframeskip: if too many slowdowns, game should switch to fixed stars/30 fps

- char grid & sprites too high by 8 pixels
  (top status bar is OK, bottom & field chars are not, maybe
  better for Amiga display after all!
