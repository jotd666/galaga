
- boss not exploding when shot the second time, no score
  all because no shots after first shot !! shots cancelled or enemies too fast??
  now regression shoot not working at all
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- generate sprite_cluts for hw sprite
- debug rld,rrd (called after intro)
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color ??)
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?

- orientation of attacking sprites wrong: mirrored+flipped, we should support
  attributes!!
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region 

traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!
