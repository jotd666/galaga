
- intro: ship moving but no shots, no enemies attacking:
  attack is wrong: wrong boss attacking, and going up!!
  $0C83:sub: set sprite x/y

- possible issue at l_1F1E as exg a0,a1 but d4 used?? 
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- generate sprite_cluts for hw sprite
- debug rld,rrd (called after intro)
- CREDIT displayed but wrong color, wrong row too, in windowed HIGHSCORE too low
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?
