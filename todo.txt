- double buffering!!!
- capture ship doesn't capture. f_boss_diving_down_to_capture_ship_21cb is called indefinitely
  check if l_1A4B_test_positioning_timer is reached which calls l_1A6A_ship_in_position
- crash div 0 on statistics screen: c_puts_hitmiss_ratio_0A72
  when it works, 50.  ... => 0 % is too high on screen
- illegal after game over & statistics screen
- level 4 or 5: at some point aliens stop shooting
- implement level skip & other trainer
- shoots all both missiles immediately in demo
- challenge stage: wrong enemy shot count
- scorpion clone attack: wrong (only 2, not properly oriented) & wrong colors
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color is black!!!)
- player lives:  wrong colors
- stage 1 flag not drawn, and wrong colors
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- demo: ship misses first boss on first shot: desync, hack it: if intro running
  then be nicer with detection around 0788 (sub) (add 3 of tolerance)

traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!

l_2ADA_done: all bugs arrived: phase 2 diving attacks!

maybe fixed already:

- first level second wave: one boss does something different (init issue?)
- demo: boss explosions: some frames shifted
