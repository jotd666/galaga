- red flashes (frame drop) even with very few sprites with cycle exact!!
  (why are we flashing red when only ship and double shot (single shot?) are displayed!
- default DSW are wrong
- player score not displayed
- implement level skip trainer
- shadow of boss not erased sometimes (erase optimization not working??): when changes only CLUT, not sprite code or X/Y!!
- double buffering: don't double buffer last plane for tiles
- double shot should optimize height
- crash div 0 on statistics screen: c_puts_hitmiss_ratio_0A72
  when it works, 50.  ... => 0 % is too high on screen
  watch A0/A1, HL/DE after call: 0535
     DE  80B8
     HL  99B2
  even if not crashing, percentage is wrong and wrongly placed!!

- optimize: player ship should be HW sprite, even if captured
  sprite layout: 2 slots for player ship
                 2 slots for captured ship (1 wasted)
				 2 slots for background stars (1 wasted, maybe 2 spare colors will be useful)
				 2 spare slots (maybe their 3 spare colors will be useful)
- HW sprites seem not to work but is the code aligned with .py (orientations/flip/mirror) ?

- tiles on last row can have different CLUTs and cannot be handled by dynamic colors
  generate subset of tiles (only used in last row anyway) and try to match colors with
  sprites colors else not a problem we have a few 16-31 colors left from unused sprites (5 max)

- generate proper HW sprite cluts
- make stars scroll configurable, make 30 fps / 60 fps, enable fmode=3 on AGA
- top of screen bobs are not erased
- 2 first rows colors: ??? white on real hardware
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- stars glitching (when scrolling)
- redraw bottom tiles all the time or maybe only if some sprite Y > some value
- let the demo run, game ends up accessing uninitialized memory
- missing/wrong sounds:
  * swarm sound (when)
  * all tunes
  * capture beam (with and without the ship): 227C: record game when only last bosses present
  * extra life
  * last moths attack again when on bottom of screen, but no sound is played
  
maybe already fixed:

- enemies definitely stop shooting after a few levels: check
  sub at 0D66 is it called?


traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!

l_2ADA_done: all bugs arrived: phase 2 diving attacks!
