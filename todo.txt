
- intro: ship moving but no shots, no enemies attacking:
  attack is wrong and ends up crashing after next__pool_idx_0dfb: return to "in the woods"
  

- possible issue at l_1F1E as exg a0,a1 but d4 used?? 
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- generate sprite_cluts for hw sprite
- debug rld,rrd (called after intro)
- CREDIT displayed but wrong color, wrong row too, in windowed HIGHSCORE too low
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?
