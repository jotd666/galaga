- swarm is 16 pixels too high!!
- kill captured ship makes the swarm bug: some bees stay in the air
- kill boss that captured ship: ship remains static and doesn't attack / flee
main: case_shot_captured_ship_243C
main: debug f_update_objects_23e0 when captured ship not moving
- 2P game: swarm saved position is wrong when switching players! (f_move_swarm_when_player_changes_1d32, c_player_active_switch_110c)
- missing/wrong sounds: swarm pusling sound: rip from MAME or YT video with invincible & attack sound off
- namco logo should be red
- check loop sounds when capturing

minor:

- flag tick timer sometimes super slow: loops at l_120B
- yellow flash at some point!!!
- red flashes (frame drop) even with very few sprites with cycle exact!!
  (why are we flashing red when only ship and double shot (single shot?) are displayed!
- c_plyr_initials_entry_hilite_line: one letter is yellow, rest is white/cyan??
  doesn't matter!!!
- some noise in the main fire sound: Toni is looking into this
- DSW skill level?
- double buffering: don't double buffer last plane for tiles
- double shot should optimize height
- autoframeskip: if too many slowdowns, game should switch to fixed stars/30 fps
