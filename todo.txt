
- where is bmbr_boss_pool+1 read???
db_2A3C: table+bits to rework & understand how it's read
flv tables: -base to handle

- intro: ship moving but wrong Y, no shots, no enemies attacking
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- generate sprite_cluts
- debug rld,rrd (called after intro)
- CREDIT displayed but wrong color, possibly wrong row too
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?
