- double ship attaches left then displayed right???? around 2075
- enemies definitely stop shooting after a few levels: check
  sub at 0D59
- double shot: check status, double height: if 0x30 and double height
  blit double shot (analyse sprite memory around +0x64)

- double buffering: don't double buffer last plane for tiles
- crash div 0 on statistics screen: c_puts_hitmiss_ratio_0A72
  when it works, 50.  ... => 0 % is too high on screen
  watch A0/A1, HL/DE after call: 0535
     DE  80B8
     HL  99B2

- generate proper HW sprite cluts
- make stars scroll configurable, make 30 fps / 60 fps, enable fmode=3 on AGA
- scorpion clone attack: missing cluts (when hit)
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color is black!!!)
- player lives:  wrong colors
- stage 1 flag not drawn, and wrong colors
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- redraw bottom tiles all the time or maybe only if some sprite Y > some value
- implement level skip & other trainer
- let the demo run, game ends up accessing uninitialized memory
- missing sounds:
  * boss hit (but not killed)
  * swarm sound (when)
  * all tunes
  * capture beam (with and without the ship)
  * flags at start of level
  * extra life
  
traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!

l_2ADA_done: all bugs arrived: phase 2 diving attacks!


mutants:

f_clone_attack_manager_1A80:
* check parameter for condition to enable the bonus-bee feature.
