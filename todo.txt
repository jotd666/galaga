- "cheat" key to remove all lives
- stage 60: needs indirection selects wrong stage: to test
- stage 24: flag reduction doesn't work!
- yellow flash on mutating enemy!!!
- icons not properly refreshed (bottom) when ship is erased and wraps to Y around 0 probably
- diagonal ship shots work but wrong BOB
- when capturing ship shot while using tractor beam: capture sound stays
- when "perfect" music ends, play "attack" sound: doesn't work: test again
- default DSW are wrong
- high score entry seems buggy!
- understand when l_2681_end_of_table reached, ILLEGAL remaining
- optimize: player ship should be HW sprite, even if captured
  sprite layout: 2 slots for player ship
                 2 slots for captured ship (1 wasted)
				 2 slots for background stars (1 wasted, maybe 2 spare colors will be useful)
				 2 spare slots (maybe their 3 spare colors will be useful)
- HW sprites seem not to work but is the code aligned with .py (orientations/flip/mirror) ?

- generate proper HW sprite cluts
- make stars scroll configurable, make 30 fps / 60 fps, enable fmode=3 on AGA
- red flashes (frame drop) even with very few sprites with cycle exact!!
  (why are we flashing red when only ship and double shot (single shot?) are displayed!
- redraw bottom tiles all the time or maybe only if some sprite Y > some value
- missing/wrong sounds:
  * swarm sound (when) => after ship capture, at another time???
  * missing tunes
  * last moths attack again when on bottom of screen, but no sound is played
- namco logo should be red
- double buffering: don't double buffer last plane for tiles
- double shot should optimize height
- demo: disable invincible flag
- implement level skip trainer
- c_plyr_initials_entry_hilite_line: one letter is yellow, rest is white/cyan??
