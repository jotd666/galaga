- demo: ship misses first boss on first shot (debug/log ship coords again?)
- demo: second boss not exploding when shot the second time, no score
- demo: shot goes up the screen: seems to stop too late (blitter out of range error): we should add 16 pixels on the top too
  for the buffer and allow off-screen negative ranges
- demo: third boss (alone) does not attack, explodes but no score
- demo: boss explosions: some frames shifted
- demo: trajectories are wrong, return to swarm doesn't work (check sub: 0E08) bees never stop
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- generate sprite_cluts for hw sprite
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color is black!!!)
- start game: ship shoots all the time & goes left, probably demo controls
  completely saturated
- player lives: 5 lives??? and stage flag immediately following, and wrong colors
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?
