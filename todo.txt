

- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- generate sprite_cluts for hw sprite
- debug rld,rrd (called after intro)
- CREDIT displayed but wrong color, wrong row too, in windowed HIGHSCORE too low
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?

- orientation of attacking sprites wrong: mirrored+flipped, we should support
  attributes!!
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
 

trace cpu with regs:

trace galaga.tr,,,{tracelog "A=%02X, B=%02X, C=%02X, D=%02X, E=%02X, H=%02X, L=%02X, IX=%04X ",a,b,c,d,e,h,l,ix}
