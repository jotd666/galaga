- demo: ship misses first boss on first shot (debug/log ship coords again?)
- demo: second/third boss not exploding when shot the second time, no score
- demo: boss explosions: some frames shifted
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- start game screen: all extra ship scores are 00000
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color is black!!!)
- start game: ship shoots all the time & goes left, probably demo controls
  completely saturated
- player lives: 5 lives??? dip switch issue and wrong colors
- stage flag not drawn, and wrong colors
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?
- original swarm: missing 1 boss, and 1 column of red bees!

traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!

case_nearly_fatally_shot_24B2: ok (almost) for static (150) shot
but not when shooting flying boss

E3A sub: set pos check current x/Y vs homing in MAME then in amiga


demo: boss disappearing because case_make_object_inactive_0e49 (sub) is called from for__pool_idx_08E4
right after having been shot (because status = 4)
should update sprite (explosion) by calling case_nearly_fatally_shot_24B2 several times
debug in MAME!!
