- mockup of 40+ sprites
- 1/2 HW sprites for ship, 2 for lasers
- 1 sprite for stars (takes a slot of 2 sprites!)
- 2 sprites for explosions?

- where is bmbr_boss_pool+1 read???
db_2A3C: table+bits to rework & understand how it's read
flv tables: -base to handle

- generate sprite_cluts
- handle color cluts (w_colorram is going to change the whole line with copper!!!)
  only exception is: when score is entered, letters can be of different colors in a row
  else they're of the same color! => display letters on the 5th plane
- debug rld,rrd (called after intro)
- yellow flashes
- CREDIT not displayed!
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?

- tiles strategy: mega hack (which should work!!). We noticed
  * when a line is colored, all chars are of the same color (notable
    exception: when entering high score)
  * chars are mostly mono-planar (except for flags & lives: 3 colors + black)
  
=> this calls for:
   - extra 5th plane only for letters
   - copper effect to change used colors dynamically
   - for multi-color tiles, use other planes, but manage to encode tiles
     on 2 bitplanes only so the colors used are 16 20 24 (sprites don't use them)
	 which allow to display letters in different colors (highscore entering, special case)
	 and also flags & life tiles
   - special case for namco logo which seem to be on a different color?
   - hardware sprites can be used without color conflicts
   - first 4 bitplanes can be used almost without conflicts. Just maybe redraw
     lives & flags each time or if sprite goes past them
   - tractor beam are multi-color tiles, but the ship is a HW sprite so we get away with it
