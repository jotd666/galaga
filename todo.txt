- capture ship doesn't capture
- illegal/break when ship is hit by bomb: break 649 sub HL????
- second wave: one boss does something different (init issue?)
- shoots all both missiles immediately (main: 1766), demo AND in-game
- demo: ship misses first boss on first shot: desync, hack it: if intro running
  then be nicer with detection around 0788 (sub) (add 3 of tolerance)
- demo: boss explosions: some frames shifted
- enemy bombs: sometimes stop!
- start game screen: all extra ship scores are 00000
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color is black!!!)
- player lives: 5 lives??? dip switch issue and wrong colors
- stage 1 flag not drawn, and wrong colors
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented

traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!
