- demo: ship misses first boss on first shot: missile detection not 100% accurate!
- demo: boss explosions: some frames shifted
- demo: shoots all both missiles immediately (main: 1766), also in-game
- ACTIVE_BITPLANE_MASK not implemented
- enemy bombs: sometimes stop!
- start game screen: all extra ship scores are 00000
- 2 first rows not shown (attribute/color is black!!!)
- illegal/break when ship is hit by bomb
- player lives: 5 lives??? dip switch issue and wrong colors
- stage flag not drawn, and wrong colors
- sprite priorities wrong: stars should be behind
- stars & colors trashed near the PAL wait region: copperlist conflict between sprite/color
- remove red timer flashes, maybe speedup using F10?


traj issues: Traj computed in subcpu D23 / D50 probe there!
