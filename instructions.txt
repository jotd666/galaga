SKILL/K/N,STARTLIVES/K/N

Cheats:

INVINCIBLE: invincible
INFLIVES: infinite lives
CHEATKEYS: function keys cheat: 
 * F1: diamond align (needs pushing on diamond to enable)
 * F2: complete level
 * F3: snobee chicken
 * F4: toggle invincible
STARTLEVEL: from 1 to 16
BAT50000: bonus life at 50000 instead of 30000

Options/dipswitches:

QUICKMAZEDRAW: fast maze path drawing
NOINTERMISSIONS: no small acts every other level
ALTMUSIC: for people allergic to popcorn, music of set 2 has been recreated
SKILL: 0-3 (3: hardest)
STARTLIVES: 2-5 (default 3)


Hiscores save:

* If any cheat key is pressed (when cheatkeys are on), highscores won't be saved
* infinite lives & invincibility make game run forever so no hiscore save either!
* startlevel can be used, highscores will be saved (doesn't make the game easier...)
* whdload: quit whdload with quitkey to allow highscore save
* floppy: quit game with "ESC" and unprotect the floppy to allow highscore save

JOTD general strategy (well that's what I gathered so far):

- don't wander in the open too much, always hide in ice block mazes. Snobees
  are slowed down specially when breaking ice blocks. Plus you can crush them
  when an opportunity comes
- when you see that a snobee is aligning to break all the blocks to get to you,
  wait for it, and when there's only one block remaining push it (time it properly
  if snobee is breaking a block just next to the block you want to push: too late snobee
  will break it, too soon it will be stopped by the unbroken block)  
- if you can kill a snobee, don't wait, do it. When snobee is hatching, you have to wait
  until it's almost ready to walk or the ice block will go through it (also often means
  dying because now the snobee is just next to you without any ice block)
- don't obsess too much on aligning the diamonds. At higher levels, even when
  diamonds are almost aligned, it's risky to attempt it. You'll get to 30000 points
  or 50000 points for the only extra life even without them.
- for a big score, try to hit several snobees with one ice block. Max is 6400
  for all 4 snobees. Stunning them using the walls makes multi-hit easier.
- remember where the unhatched eggs are (flashing at start, and when a snobee spawns)
  You get 500 points (only) when destroying the eggs, but in the higher levels it means
  that it's not going to hatch untimely and break more blocks than you'd want
- when escaping, always flee from the snobees diagonally, going to the opposite corner
- always try to anticipate an escape route that doesn't involve block breaking
  or block pushing. You'll waste less time escaping
- in first levels, snobees are slower than you. Depending on the skill level, snobees
  catch up with you in later levels. Even in the easy skill level, snobees are faster
  than you in level 9. The only way to escape them is to turn often.
- you can create a corridor between the wall and one or several diamond blocks
  Ideally, with 3 aligned diamonds making a corridor next to the wall, you just
  have to wait for the snobees to workaround the diamonds and you can get them by
  shaking the wall without risking them to kill you at the same time, even in higher
  levels.
- a similar strategy is to put a diamond block almost in the corner. If snobees attack
  one at a time, select the wall to shake and get them
- if you lose a life and there are 4+ snobees, it's tough as you are now surrounded
  from all corners. React fast and kill them to get breating space in a corner. Particularly
  true on latest levels. You can breeze through a very hard level in one life, but as
  soon as you lose a life, things are much harder than at first attempt: less ice blocks,
  no chance to get a corner without enemies.

Good luck! (my personal record is level 14 on easy mode. Couldn't get further without cheating)
